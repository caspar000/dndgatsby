The rutted track emerges from a wooded hillside, and you
catch your first glimpse of Tao. The town consists of
forty or fifty simple log buildings, some built on old fieldstone
foundations. More old ruins-crumbling stone walls covered
in ivy and briars-surround the newer houses and shops,
showing how this must have been a much larger town in
centuries past. Most of the newer buildings are set on the
sides of the cart track, which widens into a muddy main
street of sorts as it climbs toward a ruined manor house on a
hillside at the east side of town.  

As you approach, you see children playing on the town green
and townsfolk tending to chores or running errands at shops.
Many people look up as you approach, but all return to their
business as you go by.  

Sildar seems much more at ease.  

"My friends," he says, "let us secure lodgings. I'm told the
local inn is very quaint."
