The States of Germandia has existed for at least 500 years. It's creation
is shrowded in legend. It is said that 12 extraordinary individuals have
gathered in times of great distress and created a small nation which was 
then slowly expanded upon to create what is today known as the States of
Germandia. One of the adventurers, Zorgal, is said to still be alive in his
ancient tower in the northern parts of Germandia. The states are wealthy, 
healthy, and with a mixed population. Humans still outnumber other races, 
making up at least 64% of the whole population. Germandia had a military 
history with what is now known as the Northern Confederation and is currently
at war with the Kou Empire.
