The frontier town of Tao is built on the ruins of a much older settlement. Hundreds of years ago, the old Tao was a thriving human town 
whose people were firmly allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Northern Realms. However, an ord horde laid waste to the settlement, 
and Tao was abondoned for centuries.

In the last three or four years, hardy settlers from the cities of Lua and Bergbrux have begun the hard work of reclaiming the ruins of Tao. 
A bustling frontier settlement has grown up on the site of the old town, and is home now to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors 
drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains. Unfortunately, more than a few bandits and brigands have settled 
here as well, taking advantage of the fact that the area has no local lord or authority to chase them off. A gang known as the Redbrands has 
controlled Tao for the past two months, extorting and bullying everyone in town. The gang is led by a mysterious figure known to the townsfolk 
as Glasstaff.

After Sildar entered the town, he has become the leading figure of the town, overthrowing the previous elected townsmaster, who was a fat bumbling
fool, and a puppet of the Redbrands.

### Stonehill Inn
In the center of town stands a large, newly built roadhouse of fieldstone
and rought-hewn timbers. The common room is filled with locals nursing mugs
of ale or cider, all of them eyeing strangers with curiosity. The proprietor
is a short, friendly young human male named Toblen Stonehill.

### Barthen's Provisions
Barthen's is the biggest trading post in Phandalin. Its shelves
stock most ordinary goods and supplies, including backpacks, bedrolls, rope, and rations. The place is open from sunup to sundown. Barthen's does not stock weapons or armor, but characters can purchase other adventuring gear here, with the exception of items that cost more than 25 gp. Characters in need of weapons or armor are directed to the Lionshield Coster. Adventurers have provided Gungrens goods to Barthern and earned 60gp as a reward.

### Lionshield Coster
Lionshield Coster is the only place in Tao that sells weapons. THey don't offer weapons that are over 50gp and the owner doesn't sell weapons to suspecious
or dangerous individuals, such as the Redbrands. Badri has returned the stolen goods to the owner, gaining good friendship with him.
