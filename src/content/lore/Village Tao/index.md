The frontier town of Tao is built on the ruins of a much older settlement. Hundreds of years ago, the old Tao was a thriving human town 
whose people were firmly allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Northern Realms. However, an ord horde laid waste to the settlement, 
and Tao was abondoned for centuries.

In the last three or four years, hardy settlers from the cities of Lua and Bergbrux have begun the hard work of reclaiming the ruins of Tao. 
A bustling frontier settlement has grown up on the site of the old town, and is home now to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors 
drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains. Unfortunately, more than a few bandits and brigands have settled 
here as well, taking advantage of the fact that the area has no local lord or authority to chase them off. A gang known as the Redbrands has 
controlled Tao for the past two months, extorting and bullying everyone in town. The gang is led by a mysterious figure known to the townsfolk 
as Glasstaff.
