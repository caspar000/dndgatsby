Org is a small farming village next to the Port of Lua which provides the town with grain, potatoes and other necessities.

### Alderleaf Farm
A wealthy farm currently in the sole possesion of Qelline Alderleaf. Adventurers found out that she had a love affair with
a lazy Halfling <a href="/lore/port-of-lua">Milo Goodbarrel</a> but decided to marry a Alderleaf instead. This promted Milo to 
leave Org and try his luck in Port of Lua where he has made a fortune by being a general salesperson. Quellines husband is now 
deceased and she has already sent her kids to better parts of the world. Despite this, Milo and Qelline haven't been able to get
together like the old days. Qelline is friendly towards the adventurers and will provide food and lodging any time they are in 
this village.<br/>
