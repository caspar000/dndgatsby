The Port of Lua is one of the most important trade ports in the region. This is the only Germandian
port that has access to the Elven Kritarchy. It connects many northern trade routes to the states and
is thus very wealthy.

The city is of moderate size. Next to the docks a great archways leads into the courtyard of a plaster building decorated 
in shades of ochre and mustard. Banners of red fabric stretched across the courtyard provide shade for 
the bustling market below, where crowds of citizens browse the well-stocked stalls that line each wall.
Due to large trade activity, one of the main thieves guild operations can be found in this town.

### The Beached Leviathan

The Beached Leviathan is the most unique looking tavern in this city. It is a former pirate vessel that 
gave up its days of pillaging to become a permanent fixture in the port of Lua. It is also the main house 
for thieves guild members, adventurers, and rogues. The weathered exterior of this tavern conceals a 
magnificent interior decorated in fine oak and cherry woodwork. Old nautical lanterns and fishing nets 
decorate the walls. These days, the tavern's owner, a retired pirate named Harrag, often leaves the management 
of the bar to his "first mate", a human woman named Andrella.
