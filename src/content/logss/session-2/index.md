## Session 2

On the road to Tao the adventurers met with a Knight and a Priest engaged in battle with an Ogre. They
decided to help these people in need and decemated the Ogre in seconds. They found out that these
people were part of the Order of the Gauntlets and they got a recommendation letter to join their order
if they brought it to a man named Daaran Edermath, a retired adventurer and part of the order, in Tao.

They went to Tao with no further complications. They found this village in great need of help, with a group
of bandits who called themselves Redbrands terorizing and controlling the city. Sildar went to search for his
friend Iarno who was sent here by the Lords Alliance to keep order in the town. The party split up to get information
and gain insight about the town. Morgan and Arnold brought supplies to Barthen and got into a little trouble
with four Redbrand thugs, but they managed to not get into a fight due tue Arnolds pure autism. Ali talked
to Daaran and found out that if he wishes to join the order, he would have to proove himself though helping
daran in a sidequest. Nydian found out all the rumors that he could in this town. Badri returned the stolen
supplies to the Lionshield shop, gaining a new friendship and potential future alliance. They stayed at the
Stonehill Inn and decided to go adventuring the next day. They took on a job to deal with the orcs who were
attacking some people up north near the village. Before they set out towards this quest, they got some potions
by helping a local priestess get information about a powerful wizards spellbook. Morgan met with a banshe who
was not too disgusted by his presence. They found the orcs hideout and set up a trap for them. Badri created
a illusionary smell to get the orcs in a single place, Morgan conjured up an image of delicious food while Ali,
Nydian, and Badri prepared their insta kill combo to get rid of the orc party. The orcs fell for the trap, they
gatherd in a single spot, Badri poured his oil on them and Ali and Nydian cooked most of them alive. The remaining
Ogre was dealt with promptly, without having a chance to retaliate. The adventurers went back to the village, got
their reward, and rested until the next day, contemplating their recent gain in experience.
