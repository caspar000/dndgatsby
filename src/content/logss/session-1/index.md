## Session 1

<a href="/lore/port-of-lua">The Beached Leviathan</a> was unusually empty. Only a handful of tables were filled with people. The left corner
table was occupied by the adventurers who haven't gathered here for at least two months... They were tired,
broke, and hungry. The arrival of one *Gungren Rockseeker*, a lound and boisterious shield dwarf sporting a
bushy beard that has been dyed a fiery red, has changed the mood. He arrived with a quiet and dignified male
with features of greying hair, who looked like a knight. He was familiar with some of the adventurers and 
invited them for a drink.

It was general knowledge that the thieves guild didn't offer many jobs lately. The legislative name change of
the Port from Lia to Lua has brought the eyes of many officials to the city, making the usual thieves guild 
activities problematic. Gungren was happy to inform the adventurers that he has a relatively easy job of transforming
a cart filled with supplies to a village named Tao. He would pay them 10 gold each and would offer more potential
jobs in the future, the nature of which he didn't disclose. The party accepted his offer, bought some supplies, and
set out on the road with the cart the next day, while Gungren and the knight named Sildar left the city the previous
morning.

When inspecting the cart, the stable owner <a href="/lore/port-of-lua">Milo Goodbarrel</a>, asked Nydian to send his regards to a woman named
<a href="/lore/village-org">Qelline Alderleaf</a> at the Alderleaf farm in the village Org. He did so, finding out more about the relationship 
between these two and securing free lodging and food for the entire party. Germand has charmed Qelline with his
pretty face and buldging muscles. Badri bought some Maionezi and put all of the cart supplies into the bag of holding
that he previously crafted for such an occasion. Ralts tried to steal 5 silver coins from Morgan, awakening him
in the middle of the night, but convincing him that they just fell out of his pocket and he was there to collect
them. Germand spent the whole night with Qelline.

At the eve of the next day the adventurers found two dead horses on the road belonging to Gungren and Sildar.
They were ambushed by goblins while investigating the scene, but they successfully killed three and captured the last
fleeing one. They gathered info that these two were captured by the orders of the King Grol, who was the leader
of the Cragmow goblin tribe. They were first taken to the nearby encampment where a Bugbear named Klarg is the
leader. The adventurers navigated a hidden path filled with traps and found the Goblin hideout. They eradicated
the whole cave leaving no goblin alive, melting both Klarg and his right hand man. Sildar was beat up but alive.
He asked the adventurers to take him to Tao. He would pay them 50 gold if they did so. Before they reached Tao, he told
them many interesting details about the nature of the kidnapping, revealing a mysterious entity called *The Black Spider*...
